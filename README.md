# WELCOME

## Motivation

The primary motivation for this repository is to help AI learners and others get one more problem set with easy to get dataset to try skills upon.

## About
This is a open source python repository for n*n maze data generation.

## Algorithms used

- Maze generation algorithms: [(utils/maze/create)](utils/maze/create.py) 
- solving algorithms [(utils/maze/solve)](utils/maze/solve.py)

## Default maze symbols

Maze symbols are different symbols used to refer to different maze parts. The following symbols are default used to refer to the respective maze property.

- \# => Maze wall
- " " (empty space) => path allowed to move through
- . => the path covered (travelled through)
- S => the starting point in the maze
- E => the target point in the maze

You can change the symbols in [create_maze](maze.py)
## Create dataset

Use the create_maze function built on top of [utils/maze/](utils/maze/) in [maze.py](maze.py) to customize the data generation.

## PR your model
Trained your model? Why to keep your hardwork locally! PR your model [here](models/). Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for sure first.

## Dataset references

If you have created your dataset you can save other's time by referencing to it on [DATASETS.md](DATASETS.md). Make sure to go through [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## CONTRIBUTION

Each contribution just makes it more better then earlier. You are open to add and improve the existing implementations. Make sure to go through [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
